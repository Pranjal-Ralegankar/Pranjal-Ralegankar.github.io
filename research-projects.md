The Standard Model of particle physics has had resounding success in explaining the nature of fundamental particles that form the building block of all known matter. However, observations of the universe suggest that Standard Model particles only comprise around 15% of the matter in the universe. The rest of the unknown matter (dark matter) has not yet been observed to show any interaction with the Standard Model particles. An explanation for the lack of interaction could be because dark matter does not interact with the Strong and Electroweak forces of the Standard Model.

While dark matter could be the one and only particle with the odd feature of not interacting with Standard Model forces, a more generic approach would be to consider a whole hidden sector of particles with this non-interacting property. If such a hidden sector exists, then it could have interesting impact in the first few seconds after the birth of the universe because its particles could form a plasma that is at a different temperature than the plasma formed by the Standard Model particles.

In my PhD research, I have explored different consequences due to the presence of a hidden sector thermally decoupled from the Standard Model particles’ plasma.

Below I provide a very succint (and a bit technical) summary of these projects. Click on the icons or title, to see a bit less technical explanation of the project. I also decribe some of my favourite calculations that couldn’t be discussed in detail in the publications. You’ll also find links to papers with further technical details there.

This enhancement of dark matter perturbations causes most of dark matter to be bounded in microhalos today, which are potentially observable.

We show that a model where dark matter produced in the early universe decays into a new dark matter particle in the late universe, can explain AMS-02 observation and satisfy constraints from CMB.
